## Prebuilt Linux tarballs — which one to download (#355)

The GitHub releases carry several Linux x86-64 tarballs. **They are not
interchangeable, and the GPU ones cannot fall back to CPU.**

| tarball | needs on the host | falls back to CPU? |
|---|---|---|
| `stelnettts-linux-x86_64.tar.gz` | nothing beyond base glibc | n/a — it *is* the CPU build |
| `stelnettts-linux-x86_64-avx512.tar.gz` | an AVX-512 CPU | n/a |
| `stelnettts-linux-x86_64-cuda.tar.gz` | **NVIDIA driver** (`libcuda.so.1`) + CUDA 12 runtime (`libcudart.so.12`, `libcublas.so.12`) | **no** |
| `stelnettts-linux-x86_64-cuda13.tar.gz` | NVIDIA driver + CUDA 13 runtime | **no** |
| `stelnettts-linux-x86_64-hip.tar.gz` | ROCm runtime | **no** |
| `stelnettts-linux-x86_64-vulkan.tar.gz` | a Vulkan loader + ICD | **no** |

The GPU runtimes are deliberately **not** bundled — shipping a driver library
would be wrong (it must match the kernel module) and redistributing the CUDA
runtime has its own terms. `scripts/bundle-linux-runtime.sh` skips them by
name and `scripts/check-bundled-deps.py` allow-lists them per leg, so this is a
reviewed decision rather than an oversight.

The consequence is worth stating plainly, because it surprises people:

```
$ ./stelnettts --help
./stelnettts: error while loading shared libraries: libcuda.so.1:
cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
$ echo $?
127
```

Those libraries are hard `DT_NEEDED` entries, so **the dynamic loader fails
before `main()` runs**. StelnetTTS's "auto-select the best backend, fall back to
CPU" logic lives inside `main()` and never gets the chance. A container that has
the CUDA toolkit but no GPU passthrough, or a host whose driver was removed,
will restart in a loop with exit 127 and no StelnetTTS output at all.

**If you might run without a GPU, use `stelnettts-linux-x86_64.tar.gz`.** It is
the same CLI; it just has no GPU backend compiled in. Shipping both and picking
at startup is a reasonable pattern for images that must run on either.

Verify what a given tarball actually requires before deploying it:

```bash
readelf -d stelnettts | grep NEEDED
```

> **Can the GPU build degrade gracefully instead?** Yes, if you build it
> yourself: `-DGGML_BACKEND_DL=ON -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON` makes each backend a
> `dlopen`-ed module, so a missing CUDA driver leaves the CUDA backend
> unregistered instead of killing the process. This works and is verified on
> Metal and CPU — see [the #355 section](#graceful-degradation-via-ggml_backend_dl-355)
> for the measured transcripts and the two throughput caveats. The prebuilt
> tarballs below are still statically linked, because flipping the release leg
> needs an A/B on real CUDA, HIP and Vulkan hardware first.

## Windows CUDA: split downloads (#342)

The Windows CUDA packages bundle three NVIDIA runtime DLLs — `cudart64_*.dll`,
`cublas64_*.dll` and `cublasLt64_*.dll` — so they work on a host that never
added the CUDA `bin` directory to `PATH`. They also dominate the download, and
they change far less often than we cut releases. Re-fetching them for every
version is wasted bandwidth, which is painful if github.com is slow for you.

So each release ships both forms:

| asset | contains |
|---|---|
| `stelnettts-windows-x86_64-cuda.zip` | CLI, self-contained |
| `stelnettts-windows-x86_64-cuda-non-cuda.zip` | CLI, **without** the three DLLs |
| `libstelnettts-windows-x86_64-cuda.tar.gz` | shared libs + headers, self-contained |
| `libstelnettts-windows-x86_64-cuda-non-cuda.tar.gz` | shared libs + headers, **without** the three DLLs |
| `cudart64_*.dll`, `cublas64_*.dll`, `cublasLt64_*.dll` | the three DLLs, on their own |
| `stelnettts-windows-x86_64-cuda-runtime-sha256.txt` | SHA-256 of each of the three |

To upgrade without re-downloading the runtime: take the `-non-cuda` archive,
unpack it, and copy the three DLLs you already have next to `stelnettts.exe`
(for the libs package, into `bin\`).

The three DLLs are published **once** per release and shared by both packages —
sound only because every CUDA-bundling job pins the same toolkit (12.8.0).
`tools/check-cuda-split-packaging.py` enforces that, along with the rule that
any job bundling them must also ship a split archive and attach it to the
release. Check the SHA-256 manifest before reusing DLLs from an older download;
a CUDA version bump changes the filenames, which is your signal to re-fetch.

## Prerequisites

- C++17 compiler (GCC 10+, Clang 12+, MSVC 19.30+)
- CMake 3.14+
- `curl` or `wget` on `$PATH` if you want to use `-m auto` auto-download

Optional:
- `libavformat` / `libavcodec` / `libavutil` / `libswresample` for
  Opus / M4A / WebM ingestion (`-DSTELNETTTS_FFMPEG=ON`).
- `libopenblas` / MKL / Accelerate — speeds up CPU-side matmuls for
  Conformer-based encoders (parakeet, canary, cohere, granite,
  fastconformer-ctc). The ggml CPU backend picks BLAS up automatically
  when present at build time; no StelnetTTS flag is needed.
- CUDA / Metal / Vulkan / MUSA / SYCL toolchains for GPU acceleration —
  enabled via ggml's standard flags (`-DGGML_CUDA=ON`,
  `-DGGML_METAL=ON`, `-DGGML_VULKAN=ON`, `-DGGML_MUSA=ON`,
  `-DGGML_SYCL=ON`). On CUDA, set
  `GGML_CUDA_ENABLE_UNIFIED_MEMORY=1` at runtime to allow swapping
  to system RAM when VRAM is exhausted.
- `sherpa-onnx` binaries on `$PATH` if you want
  `--diarize-method sherpa` with ONNX models.

No Python, PyTorch, or pip is required at runtime.

## Linux / macOS

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Cyna/StelnetTTS
cd StelnetTTS
# if you already cloned without --recursive:
#   git submodule update --init --recursive

cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build -j$(nproc)
```

> The bundled `ggml/` submodule is required. A non-recursive clone leaves it
> empty; CMake now stops early with a message telling you to run
> `git submodule update --init --recursive`.

The default build produces every CLI target. Binaries land in
`build/bin/`:

| Binary | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `stelnettts` | Main CLI (transcribe / TTS / server) |
| `stelnettts-quantize` | Re-quantize any GGUF model — see [quantize.md](quantize.md) |
| `stelnettts-diff` | Per-stage cosine-similarity diff vs Python reference |

To build only the library (faster CI builds), pass
`--target stelnettts-lib`:

```bash
cmake --build build -j$(nproc) --target stelnettts-lib
```

### CMake presets

The repo ships a `CMakePresets.json` with sensible defaults
(Release + tests off + ccache friction off):

```bash
cmake --preset default      # Release
cmake --preset debug        # Debug
cmake --preset linux        # Release + OpenMP
cmake --build build -j$(nproc)
```

### Convenience build script

`scripts/dev-build.sh` wraps the configure + build with platform-aware
defaults (Ninja, ccache, OpenMP, mold linker on Linux):

```bash
scripts/dev-build.sh                                  # default target
scripts/dev-build.sh --target stelnettts-quantize       # build a different target
scripts/dev-build.sh --reconfigure -DGGML_VULKAN=ON   # extra cmake args
```

## Windows (convenience scripts)

Two batch scripts handle the Windows build without requiring a
pre-opened Developer Command Prompt. They use `vswhere.exe` to locate
Visual Studio 2022 automatically, call `vcvars64.bat`, then drive
CMake + Ninja.

### `build-windows.bat` — CPU build

```cmd
build-windows.bat
```

Produces `build\bin\stelnettts.exe`. Extra CMake flags can be appended:

```cmd
build-windows.bat -DSTELNETTTS_CURL=ON   :: enable libcurl fallback
build-windows.bat -DGGML_CUDA=ON       :: NVIDIA GPU (CUDA must be installed)
build-windows.bat -DGGML_CUDA=ON -DCMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES=60  :: Tesla P100
```

Tesla P100 is a Pascal GPU with compute capability 6.0 (`sm_60`). Use a
CUDA 12.x toolkit when building for it; CUDA 13 no longer generates code
for Pascal GPUs.

What it does:
1. Locates `vswhere.exe` under `%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Microsoft Visual Studio\Installer\`.
2. Finds the latest VS 2022 installation that includes the VC++ toolchain.
3. Calls `vcvars64.bat` to initialize the 64-bit MSVC environment.
4. Runs `cmake -G Ninja -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release [extra flags]`.
5. Builds the `stelnettts` target → `build\bin\stelnettts.exe`.

### `build-vulkan.bat` — Vulkan GPU build

```cmd
build-vulkan.bat
```

Produces `build-vulkan\bin\stelnettts.exe` with the Vulkan compute backend
enabled. In addition to the VS detection above, it:

1. Checks `%VULKAN_SDK%`. If unset, scans `C:\VulkanSDK\` for the
   newest installed version and sets `VULKAN_SDK` accordingly.
2. Adds `-DGGML_VULKAN=ON -DGGML_CUDA=OFF` so CUDA is not accidentally
   pulled in if the CUDA toolkit is also installed.
3. Writes the build into a separate `build-vulkan\` directory so it
   coexists with a CPU build.

```cmd
:: Typical usage — VULKAN_SDK is picked up automatically
build-vulkan.bat

:: Override Vulkan SDK location explicitly
set VULKAN_SDK=C:\VulkanSDK\1.4.304.1
build-vulkan.bat

:: Run on Vulkan, pinned to GPU 1 (NVIDIA on a hybrid laptop)
build-vulkan\bin\stelnettts.exe --gpu-backend vulkan -dev 1 -m model.gguf -f audio.wav
```

Important:
- `build-windows.bat -DGGML_CUDA=ON` produces a CUDA build, **not** a
  Vulkan build.
- `--gpu-backend vulkan` only works if the binary was actually built
  with Vulkan support.
- On hybrid laptops, Vulkan device `0` may be the integrated GPU. Use
  `-dev N` to pin the discrete GPU if needed.

Both scripts exit with a non-zero code and a `[ERROR]` message if any
step fails (VS not found, CMake configure error, build error).

### Consuming `libstelnettts` from a language binding (Rust / Go / …)

These scripts build the **CLI**, but adding `-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON` also
produces `libstelnettts` (`build\src\stelnettts.lib` + the DLL). Three ways to link
it from a binding:

- **This local build** — `build-windows.bat -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON [-DGGML_CUDA=ON]`,
  then point the binding's `STELNETTTS_SYS_LIB_DIR` at the `build\` dir (its
  `build.rs` now finds the single-config `build\src\stelnettts.lib`); put the
  directory holding `stelnettts.dll` on `PATH`.
- **Prebuilt bundle** — download `libstelnettts-windows-x86_64[-cuda].tar.gz` from
  [Releases](https://github.com/Cyna/StelnetTTS/releases), extract, set
  `STELNETTTS_SYS_LIB_DIR` to the bundle root + put its `bin\` on `PATH`.
- **git dependency** — the binding's `build.rs` runs cmake for you (needs VS 2022
  + CMake; honours the `cuda`/`vulkan` features).

Exact per-OS environment is in the Rust
[`stelnettts-sys` README](../stelnettts-sys/README.md#prebuilt-release-bundle-no-build).

## GPU backends

StelnetTTS builds against ggml's GPU backends. Pick the one matching
your hardware at configure time:

```bash
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DGGML_CUDA=ON     # NVIDIA
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DGGML_METAL=ON    # Apple Silicon
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DGGML_VULKAN=ON   # cross-vendor
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DGGML_MUSA=ON     # Moore Threads
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DGGML_SYCL=ON     # Intel oneAPI
```

You can compile multiple backends into one binary; ggml will pick the
highest-priority compiled backend at runtime
(CUDA > Metal > Vulkan > MUSA > SYCL > CPU). Force a specific backend
with `--gpu-backend <name>`, and pin a device with `-dev N`:

```bash
stelnettts --gpu-backend vulkan -dev 1 -m model.gguf -f audio.wav
stelnettts --gpu-backend cpu -m model.gguf -f audio.wav        # benchmarking
```

## Opus / AAC support (default, no ffmpeg, no libopus)

`.opus` (Ogg/Opus, **including WebM/Matroska Opus**) and raw ADTS `.aac`
(AAC-LC) decode natively through the in-tree clean-room
[glint](https://github.com/Cyna/glint) decoder — **no ffmpeg and no
libopus needed** — via the library `stelnettts_audio_load` API used by the
bindings. glint is RFC-conformant for Opus (all 12 RFC 6716/8251 vectors), so
this works on every platform including WASM, out of the box. A build with
`-DSTELNETTTS_OPUS=OFF` (no libopus linked at all) still decodes `.opus` and
WebM/Opus.

libopus + opusfile remains available as an optional Opus fallback, selected with
`STELNETTTS_OPUS_DECODER=libopus`. It's on by default (`STELNETTTS_OPUS`) when the
system `opusfile` is found via pkg-config (e.g. `apt install libopusfile-dev`,
`brew install opusfile`), but is no longer required for any input format. On
platforms without system libs (Windows / iOS / Android / WASM), build it
statically:

```bash
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DSTELNETTTS_OPUS_FETCH=ON
```

Container AAC (`.m4a` / `.alac` / `.caf`) decodes natively on **Apple**
(macOS/iOS) via AudioToolbox, or via libfdk-aac (`dlopen`) on Linux/Windows —
also no ffmpeg. See [cli.md](cli.md#audio-formats) for the full format matrix.

## AMR-NB / AMR-WB support (telephony + voicemail recordings)

`.amr` (AMR-NB 8 kHz) and AMR-WB 16 kHz decode via
[opencore-amr](https://github.com/Cyna/opencore-amr) (Apache-2.0) — the
standard codecs for mobile voice recordings and voicemail. On by default
(`STELNETTTS_AMR`) when the system libraries are found via pkg-config
(`apt install libopencore-amrnb-dev libopencore-amrwb-dev`,
`brew install opencore-amr`). Without them, AMR is simply skipped and the build
succeeds — the CMake status line tells you which path was taken.

To build the decoder statically instead (no system packages — Windows, Android /
Termux, iOS, WASM):

```bash
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DSTELNETTTS_AMR_FETCH=ON
```

> **`register` build errors on clang ≥ 16 (fixed in v0.8.24).** opencore-amr is
> 2000s-era code that declares locals `register`, a storage class **C++17
> removed**. On a toolchain whose default is C++17 — clang 16 and newer,
> including Termux's — every one of those is a hard error:
> `error: ISO C++17 does not allow 'register' storage class specifier
> [-Wregister]` (issue #314). Older defaults only warn, which is why this

> toolchain-dependent, not architecture-dependent.
>
> v0.8.24 scopes `-Wno-register` (and clang's `-Wno-deprecated-register`) to the
> two vendored codec targets, so no flag of your own is needed. On an older
> StelnetTTS the workaround is `export CXXFLAGS="$CXXFLAGS -Wno-register"` —
> effective, but it silences the same mistake in *your* code too, so prefer
> upgrading.

## ffmpeg ingestion (container AAC/M4A off-Apple, WMA, …) — optional fallback

For formats with no permissive native decoder (container `.m4a` without
libfdk-aac, WMA, exotic containers, …), build with the optional ffmpeg fallback:

```bash
# Install ffmpeg dev libs first:
#   apt install libavformat-dev libavcodec-dev libavutil-dev libswresample-dev

cmake -B build-ffmpeg -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DSTELNETTTS_FFMPEG=ON
cmake --build build-ffmpeg -j$(nproc) --target stelnettts-lib
```

> **Upstream bug warning.** `.m4a` / `.mp4` / `.webm` containers
> currently crash StelnetTTS's ffmpeg integration. For those formats,
> pre-convert to WAV (or, on Apple, `.m4a`/AAC work natively without ffmpeg):
> ```bash
> ffmpeg -i input.m4a -ar 16000 -ac 1 -c:a pcm_s16le -y /tmp/audio.wav
> ```

## Older glibc systems

The pre-built binaries on some HuggingFace model cards (e.g.
`bin/cohere-quantize`) were built against glibc 2.38 and fail on
Ubuntu 22.04 (glibc 2.35) with:

```
./bin/cohere-quantize: /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6:
    version 'GLIBC_2.38' not found
```

The fix is to build from source — StelnetTTS has no glibc minimum
version of its own, so it builds cleanly against whatever glibc your
distro ships.

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Cyna/StelnetTTS
cd StelnetTTS
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build -j$(nproc)
ls build/bin/stelnettts-quantize
```

## Android / Termux

StelnetTTS builds natively under [Termux](https://termux.dev) on aarch64
Android devices. Use a **static build** to avoid linker conflicts with
system-installed `libggml.so` from the `whisper-cli` package (#137):

```bash
pkg install build-essential cmake git
git clone https://github.com/Cyna/StelnetTTS
cd StelnetTTS
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
      -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF \
      -DSTELNETTTS_BUILD_TESTS=OFF
cmake --build build -j$(nproc)
```

**Why static?** Termux's `whisper-cli` package installs an older
`libggml.so` into `$PREFIX/lib`. The dynamic linker finds it before the
locally built version, causing `cannot locate symbol` errors at runtime.
Static linking (`-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF`) embeds all ggml code directly
into the binary, eliminating the conflict entirely.

Strip debug symbols to reduce binary size:

```bash
strip build/bin/stelnettts*
```

**Termux clang is new enough to default to C++17**, which matters if you enable
the statically-built AMR decoder (`-DSTELNETTTS_AMR_FETCH=ON`): the vendored
opencore-amr sources use the `register` storage class that C++17 removed. Fixed
in v0.8.24 — see [AMR-NB / AMR-WB support](#amr-nb--amr-wb-support-telephony--voicemail-recordings)
if you are building an older tag (#314).

### Cross-compiling for Android (NDK)

To cross-compile from a Linux or macOS host for Android deployment
(e.g. embedding `libstelnettts.so` in an Android app), use the provided
`build-android.sh` script. This requires the
[Android NDK](https://developer.android.com/ndk) installed on the host:

```bash
export ANDROID_NDK_HOME=/path/to/android-ndk
./build-android.sh                      # all ABIs (arm64-v8a, armeabi-v7a, x86_64)
./build-android.sh --abi arm64-v8a      # single ABI
./build-android.sh --vulkan             # with Vulkan GPU support
```

Output lands in `build-android/<ABI>/src/libstelnettts.so`.

**This is not the same as building inside Termux.** The NDK
cross-compiler produces binaries linked against Android's bionic libc,
suitable for embedding in Android apps via JNI. Termux uses its own
linker and packages — use the native Termux build above instead.

### Graceful degradation via `GGML_BACKEND_DL` (#355)

`-DGGML_BACKEND_DL=ON -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON` now **configures, links and runs**.
It is opt-in: the default build is unchanged, and the release tarballs still ship
statically linked (see "flipping the release leg" below).

Three things blocked it, all now resolved:

1. **CMake** — every per-model library linked `ggml-cuda` / `ggml-metal`
   explicitly (125 sites), and under DL those are `MODULE` targets that cannot
   be linked. They now route through `stelnettts_link_ggml_*` interface targets
   that are empty in a DL build and the real backend otherwise. ✅
2. **CPU-backend symbols** — under DL even the CPU backend is a module, so
   `ggml_backend_cpu_init`, `ggml_backend_is_cpu`, `ggml_backend_cpu_set_n_threads`,
   `ggml_backend_cpu_buffer_type`, `ggml_backend_cpu_reg`, `ggml_backend_is_metal`
   and `ggml_backend_cpu_set_threadpool` are not linkable. All 426 call sites go
   through `src/core/ggml_cpu_backend.h`, whose non-DL branch is the identical
   direct call. ✅
3. **Direct CPU graph execution** — `ggml_graph_compute`,
   `ggml_graph_compute_with_ctx`, `ggml_graph_plan`, `ggml_threadpool_new` /
   `_free` and `ggml_get_type_traits_cpu`, across ~23 sites. These now go
   through the same header, which under DL routes them to a `thread_local` CPU
   backend obtained from the registry (`thread_local` because a ggml backend is
   not safe for concurrent use and several of these sites run on worker
   threads). ✅

`tests/test-cpu-backend-shim.cpp` is the equivalence gate: the same 7 cases
compile unchanged in both modes and assert arithmetic, not just return codes.
Both report *27 assertions in 7 test cases*.

Measured on an M1 with `parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3-q4_k` + Silero VAD over a 300 s
FLEURS clip, all four runs producing 608 words:

| build | device | transcript |
| --- | --- | --- |
| default | Metal | **X** |
| DL, `libggml-metal.so` present | Metal | **X** — byte-identical |
| default, `-ng` | CPU | **Y** |
| DL, `libggml-metal.so` removed | CPU | **Y** — byte-identical |

X and Y differ in two tokens. That is the ordinary CPU-vs-Metal reduction-order
divergence — it is present in the default build too, which is exactly what the
`-ng` row is there to show. DL itself changes nothing.

Removing the module is the #355 scenario in miniature: the process does not die,
it logs `load_backend: loaded CPU backend` and transcribes.

**Two limitations keep this opt-in rather than default.** ggml's CPU registry
does not expose the threadpool setter through `get_proc_address` (only
`set_n_threads` — see `ggml_backend_cpu_get_proc_address`), so a DL build cannot
install the shared worker pool and falls back to ggml's own per-call threading.
For the same reason `ggml_graph_plan` has no DL equivalent, so the hot paths
that size a work buffer once and reuse it across frames re-plan per call
instead. Neither is a correctness issue and neither has been measured; both are
throughput risks on the per-frame VAD and wav2vec2 paths.

`tests/test_ggml_audio_ops_*` are not built under DL. They call
`ggml_backend_metal_init()` by symbol on purpose — naming one exact backend with
no scheduler fallback is the point of those tests — and routing them through the
registry would pick "best available" instead.

Flipping the `-cuda` release leg to `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON` still needs an A/B on
real CUDA, HIP and Vulkan hardware; only Metal and CPU are verified above.
